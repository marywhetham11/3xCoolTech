| Test Cases Affected | Purpose of Test(s) | How Output is Incorrect | Location of Error | Error | Fix |
|:-------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----:|:---:|
| R3.9 - R3.11 | Test that the sell, update and buy forms show and submit properly | An error was created on pytest when running these tests | Test Case Code - homepage/test_39.py, Test Case Code - homepage/test_310.py, Test Case Code - homepage/test_311.py | The inputs typed into the `#quantity` and `#price` elements must be strings | Added `str()` around the `#quantity` and `#price` input values |
| R3.9 - R3.11, R4, R5, R6 | Test that the sell, update and buy forms allow the user to sell, update and buy tickets respectively | An error was created on pytest when running these tests | Code - index.html | The `#quantity` and `#price` elements which the type of number | Remove the type from both of these elements |
| R5.1 - R5.7 | Tests that an error message is displayed on the / page when the update form information is inputted incorrectly | The error messages in the test cases do not say what is specifically incorrect about the format | Test Cases - R5.md | The error messages should include a more specific description after saying the {} format is incorrect | In the error messages, after {} format is incorrect, add a more specific description of the error |
| R5.0 - R5.7 | Tests all properties of the update form, so that a ticket can be updated successfully through this form or an error message is shown if the form info is not inputted correctly | The test cases say to search for the ticket by name in the update ticket section, but the user should type the ticket name into the update form | Test Cases - R5.md | The test cases say to search for the ticket by name in the update ticket section | Remove the line "search for test_ticket by name in the update ticket section" | 
| R5.0 - R5.7 | Tests all properties of the update form, so that a ticket can be updated successfully through this form or an error message is shown if the form info is not inputted correctly | The test cases had incorrect ids for the elements in index.html | Test Cases - R5.md | The ids used in the test cases are `#update_name`, `#update_quantity`, `#update_price`, `#update_date`, `#update_submit`, `#update_message` | Changed the ids to `#name`, `#quantity`, `#price`, `#date`, `input[type="submit"]`, `#message` respectively |
| R5.6 | Tests that an error message is displayed on the / page when the ticket inputted into the update form does not exist | The steps in the test case do not say to input into the `#quantity`, `#price`, or `#date` input elements | Test Cases - R5.md | There should be an input in the `#quantity`, `#price`, and `#date` input elements | Add steps to input test_ticket's information into the `#quantity`, `#price`, and `#date` input elements |
| R4.1 - R4.5 | Test the sell form can be used to post correctly | The steps in the test case do not reflect the current elements | Test Cases - R4.md | The `#name` `#quanity`, and `#price` were misnamed | Documantation updated to reflect the proper tests |
| R4.1 - R4.5 | Test the sell form can be used to post correctly | The steps in the test case do not include the date | Test Cases - R4.md | The `#date` is not refrenced | Documantation updated to reflect tests includeing a sample `#date` in the self.type |
| Integration | The integration test was unable to be preformed twice | After a test was preformed the database included the information from the test making any further tests return false | backend.py | A function was added to backend.py which can delete a user or a ticket for testing purposes | The `integration\test_signup_post.py` test, tests the accuracy of this function |
| R4.0 - R4.5 | Tests all properties of the update form, so that a ticket can be updated successfully through this form or an error message is shown if the form info is not inputted correctly | The test cases had incorrect ids for the elements in index.html | Test Cases - R4.md | The ids used in the test cases are `#sell_name`, `#sell_quantity`, `#sell_price`, `#sell_date`, `#sell_submit`, `#sell_message` | Changed the ids to `#name`, `#quantity`, `#price`, `#date`, `input[type="submit"]`, `#message` respectively |
