## Template Modifications

### Mary's Modifications

I added a folder called registration to the frontend folder of test cases. This registration folder stored all the test cases to test R2 of the assignment. Each sub requirement is a file in the folder. These test cases are designed as specified in R2.md in the test_cases_a1 folder. 

### Graeme's Modifications

I created three new folders for the test which include /homepage/
/logout/ and /404page/. They are placed in the frontend folder.

### Josh's Modifications

I added a folder called login/ to the frontend/ test case folder. This folder holds the files to test all requirments of R1. In the folder there are .py files which test each sub-requirment. (e.g. `test_R1_2.py` tests the requirments of R1.2)
