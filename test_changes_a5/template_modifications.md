## Template Modifications

### Mary's Modifications

I added a folder called update to the frontend folder of test cases. This update folder stored all the test cases to test R5 of the assignment. Each sub requirement is a file in the folder. These test cases are designed as specified in R5.md in the test_cases_a1 folder. I also added the test_loginUser.py file to the backend folder which includes the conditional coverage white box testing for the backend.py method login_user.
