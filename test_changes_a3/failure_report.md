| R2.7.3, R2.7.4, R2.8.2 | Make sure that an error message is displayed on the /register page to when the name isn't alphanumeric | An error message is shown when the underscores and spaces are included which should be allowed | Code - frontend.py (register_post method) |  Underscores and spaces should be accepted in an alphanumeric user name | Adjust the if statement to allow for underscores and spaces in the user name |
| R2.10 | Make sure that an error message is display when the user already exists | The error message "This email has been ALREADY used" was displayed rather than "User exists" | Code - frontend.py (register_post method) | The incorrect error message displayed when the user already exists | Change the error message displayed when the user already exists to "This email has been ALREADY used" |
| R2.5.2 - R2.5.11 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /login page when the email does not follow addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 | There should be an error message when the email does not follow addr-spec | Code - frontend.py (register_post method) | There is not always an error message when the user enters an email that is not valid | Adjusted the regular expression to be more specific to cover all possible email address errors |
| R3.3 | Test that the users account balance is shown on the homepage | The h2 header had the worng id | Code - templates/index.html | Mispelled the word balance | Changed the id on the h2 element from `#user.balence` to `#user.balance` |

| R2.4.1, R2.4.2 | Test that the register form can be submitted through a /register POST request | The test information typed into the form is different than the other tests | Test Cases - R2.md | The information to be typed into the register form is different test information than the other tests | Changed the information to be typed into the register form to be test_user's information to be more consistent |
| R2.5.1 - R2.5.16, R2.6, R2.7.1 - R2.7.4, R2.8.1, R2.8.2 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /login page when the register form information is inputted incorrectly | The error messages in the test cases do not say what is specifically incorrect about the format | Test Cases - R2.md | The error messages should include a more specific description after saying the {} format is incorrect | In the error messages, after {} format is incorrect, add a more specific description of the error |
| R2.5.16 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /register page when a password does not include a special character | There should be an error message because the test name doesn't have a special character | Test Cases - R2.md | Underscore is a special character, so it should not be included in a password that should result in an error for not having a special character | Adjust the password to test from `Test_password` to `Testpassword` |
| R2.5.2 - R2.5.11 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /login page when the email does not follow addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 | There are not enough tests cases to cover all errors possible in addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 | Test Cases - R2.md | There should be more tests to test every requirement of addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 | Adjusted the test cases to test every requirements in addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 |
| R3.4 | Test that there is a logout link on the homepage | The logout link at the bottom of the page does not have
an id | Code - templates/index.html | There is no id on the `<a>` element | Change the requirement of R3.4 to only need a href attribute with `'/logout'` | R3.6 | Test that the avalible tickets are shown on the homepage | The field for the date has a different id then the requriement | Code - test_cases_a1/R3.md | The field for the date is called `expiration_date` | Changed the requirement Actions in R3.md. changed `expiration_date` to `date` |
| R3.9, R3.10, R3.11 | These tests test that the sell, buy and update forms post to /sell, /buy and /update | No message saying that the post was successful | Code - template/index.html and frontend.py | There was no block for a message on the homepage and the form post functions did not output a message | I created a h2 tag for the message on the index.html and add a render_template call to the functions sell_post, buy_post and update_post that returns a success message.|
| R3.9, R3.10, R3.11 | These tests test that the sell, buy and update forms post to /sell, /buy and /update | The form input elements have the wrong id | R3.md - Test case R3.9, R3.10, R3.11 | The id's for the input element in the actions of each requirement were wrong | In the actions of R3.9, R3.10and R3.11 I changed the name, quantity, price and sumbit ids from `#sell_name`, `#sell_quantity`, `#sell_price`, `#sell_sumbit` to `#name`, `#quantity`, `#price`, `#sumbit` for all R3.9, R3.10, R.11|
