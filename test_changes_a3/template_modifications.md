## Template Modifications

### Mary's Modifications

I added a folder called registration to the frontend folder of test cases. This registration folder stored all the test cases to test R2 of the assignment. Each sub requirement is a file in the folder. These test cases are designed as specified in R2.md in the test_cases_a1 folder. 

### Graeme's Modifications

I created three new folders for the test which include /homepage/
/logout/ and /404page/. They are placed in the frontend folder.
