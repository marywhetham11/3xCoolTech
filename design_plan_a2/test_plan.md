## Test Plan

#### 1. How test cases of different levels (frontend, backend units, integration) are organized.

Mary's Question

#### 2. The order ot the test cases (which level first which level second).

Graeme's Question

#### 3. Techniques and tools used for testing.

Pytest will be used to test each component each time the code is modified on git. Each component R1-R7 will have a .py test file
which will be ran through pytest. Each group member who programed thier component will be resplonsible for the corrisponding .py test 
file. 

#### 4. Environemnts (all the local environment and the cloud environment) for the testing.

Mary's Question

#### 5. Responsibility (who is responsible for which test case, and in case of failure, who should you contact)

Graeme's Question

#### 6. Budget Management (you have limited CI action minutes, how to monitor, keep track and minimize unncessary cost)

To ensure the system is meeting the requirments, pytest is ran upon each change to a branch. Changes will be made globaly only when
deemed as complete.
