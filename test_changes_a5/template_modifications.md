## Template Modifications

### Mary's Modifications

I added a folder called update to the frontend folder of test cases. This update folder stored all the test cases to test R5 of the assignment. Each sub requirement is a file in the folder. These test cases are designed as specified in R5.md in the test_cases_a1 folder. I also added the test_loginUser.py file to the backend folder which includes the conditional coverage white box testing for the backend.py method login_user.

I also added the test_purchaseing.py to the integration folder which test the integration of all the compents of the program inorder for a user to purchase a ticket. 


### Josh's Modifications

I added a folder called sell to the frontend folder in QA327_test. This folder holds all the test cases for R4 for the assignment. In the integration test folder, a test for registering and posting a ticket is added. Changes to backend.py allows for integrated testing to be preformed.
