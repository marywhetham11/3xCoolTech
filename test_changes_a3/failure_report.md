## Test Failures

| Test Cases Affected | Purpose of Test(s) | How Output is Incorrect | Location of Error | Error | Fix |
|:-------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----:|:---:|
| R2.2 | Make sure that the register page shows with the correct element | There was no h1 element with the text "Register" on the page | Code - register.html | The "Register" h1 element was not showing on the /register page because it was located in a block header | Moved the Register title into the block content section |
| R2.4.2, R2.5.1 - R2.5.16, R2.6, R2.7.1 - R2.7.4, R2.8.1, R2.8.2, R2.9, R2.10 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /login page when the register form information is inputted incorrectly | The error message is displayed on the /register page not the /login page | Code - frontend.py (register_post method) | The register.html template is rendered when there is an error message to output rather than login.html | Render the login.html template rather than the register.html template if there are errors in the registration process |
| R2.3 | Make sure all the elements on the register form are rendered correctly | The label for the "Confirm Password" input does not have the for attribute of "password2" | Code - register.html | On the register.html template, the "Confirm Password" label's for attribute says 'password' when it should say 'password2' | Changed `<label for="password">Confirm Password</label>` to `<label for="password2">Confirm Password</label>` |
| R2.4.2, R2.5.1 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /register page when an email is not entered | When the email is empty, the form can't be submitted but it should submit, redirect to the /login page and show an error message | Code - register.html | The register form is not submittable when an email is not entered | Remove the required from `<input class="form-control" name="email" id="email" required>` |
| R2.5.12 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /register page when a password is not entered | When the password is empty, the form can't be submitted but it should submit, redirect to the /login page and show an error message | Code - register.html | The register form is not submittable when a password is not entered | Remove the required from `<input class="form-control" type="password" name="password" id="password" required>` and `<input class="form-control" type="password" name="password2" id="password2" required>` |
| R2.7.1 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /register page when a name is not entered | When the name is empty, the form can't be submitted but it should submit, redirect to the /login page and show an error message | Code - register.html | The register form is not submittable when a name is not entered | Remove the required from `<input class="form-control" name="name" id="name">` |
| R2.7.3, R2.7.4, R2.8.2 | Make sure that an error message is displayed on the /register page to when the name isn't alphanumeric | An error message is shown when the underscores and spaces are included which should be allowed | Code - frontend.py (register_post method) |  Underscores and spaces should be accepted in an alphanumeric user name | Adjust the if statement to allow for underscores and spaces in the user name |
| R2.10 | Make sure that an error message is display when the user already exists | The error message "This email has been ALREADY used" was displayed rather than "User exists" | Code - frontend.py (register_post method) | The incorrect error message displayed when the user already exists | Change the error message displayed when the user already exists to "This email has been ALREADY used" |
| R2.5.2 - R2.5.11 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /login page when the email does not follow addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 | There should be an error message when the email does not follow addr-spec | Code - frontend.py (register_post method) | There is not always an error message when the user enters an email that is not valid | Adjusted the regular expression to be more specific to cover all possible email address errors |
| R2.4.1, R2.4.2 | Test that the register form can be submitted through a /register POST request | The test information typed into the form is different than the other tests | Test Cases - R2.md | The information to be typed into the register form is different test information than the other tests | Changed the information to be typed into the register form to be test_user's information to be more consistent |
| R2.5.1 - R2.5.16, R2.6, R2.7.1 - R2.7.4, R2.8.1, R2.8.2 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /login page when the register form information is inputted incorrectly | The error messages in the test cases do not say what is specifically incorrect about the format | Test Cases - R2.md | The error messages should include a more specific description after saying the {} format is incorrect | In the error messages, after {} format is incorrect, add a more specific description of the error |
| R2.5.16 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /register page when a password does not include a special character | There should be an error message because the test name doesn't have a special character | Test Cases - R2.md | Underscore is a special character, so it should not be included in a password that should result in an error for not having a special character | Adjust the password to test from `Test_password` to `Testpassword` |
| R2.5.2 - R2.5.11 | Make sure an error message is displayed on the /login page when the email does not follow addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 | There are not enough tests cases to cover all errors possible in addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 | Test Cases - R2.md | There should be more tests to test every requirement of addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 | Adjusted the test cases to test every requirements in addr-spec defined in RFC 5322 |
